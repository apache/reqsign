# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Apache Reqsign follows the
[Apache Software Foundation security process](https://www.apache.org/security/).
Please report suspected vulnerabilities privately to
`private@reqsign.apache.org`. If you are unsure where to send the report, use
the ASF Security Team address, `security@apache.org`. Do not open public GitHub
issues or pull requests for security reports.

When reporting, include:

- the affected crate name and version;
- the affected signing service, such as AWS SigV4, Azure Storage, Google,
  Aliyun OSS, Huawei Cloud OBS, Oracle Cloud, Tencent COS, Volcengine TOS,
  or another supported service;
- whether the issue affects direct `reqsign` use, Apache OpenDAL integration,
  or another embedding application;
- a minimal reproduction, affected request, credential-provider configuration,
  and expected versus actual behavior;
- whether credentials, bearer tokens, private keys, signed URLs, logs, or debug
  output were exposed.

## Threat Model

The security boundary, in-scope findings, out-of-scope deployment issues, and
triage guidance for this repository are documented in
[THREAT_MODEL.md](./THREAT_MODEL.md).

Apache OpenDAL is Reqsign's primary integration for custom key signing and
cloud-provider authentication, but Reqsign can also be embedded directly by
other applications. OpenDAL-specific storage behavior, operator authorization,
path policy, and storage-service trust boundaries are covered by OpenDAL's own
security documentation.
