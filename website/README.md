# Reqsign Website

The Apache Reqsign™ website — a [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) site
targeting `https://reqsign.apache.org/`.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm start        # dev server
pnpm build        # production build into build/
pnpm serve        # serve the production build locally
```

Requires Node ≥ 24.17 and pnpm 11 (`corepack enable`).

## Checks

```bash
pnpm validate-providers      # catalog ↔ cargo metadata consistency
pnpm build                   # also fails on broken internal links
pnpm check-external-assets   # no third-party runtime assets (run after build)
```

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `data/providers.json` | Provider capability catalog — the single source of truth for every capability claim; validated in CI |
| `docs/` | Concept, guide, contract, compatibility, and provider documentation |
| `docs/providers/` | One page per provider: capability facts render from the catalog via `ProviderFacts`; provider-specific prose lives in the MDX. The validator requires a page per catalog entry |
| `src/pages/` | Landing page, `/download`, `/community` |
| `src/components/landing/` | Landing sections and content model |
| `src/components/providers/` | `ProviderFacts` and `ProvidersMatrix`, the catalog-rendering components embedded in docs pages |
| `plugins/remark-include-code.js` | Includes real repository files into docs code blocks |
| `scripts/` | Catalog validator and external-asset check |
| `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` | Visual language: shared skeleton + Reqsign identity |
| `UPSTREAM_DESIGN.md` | Provenance and sync procedure for design reused from the OpenDAL website |

## Editing rules

- **Provider capabilities** change in `data/providers.json` (with source
  refs), never directly in page copy. Run the validator.
- **Code snippets** in docs come from compiled sources via
  ` ```rust file=path/to/file.rs ` fences where possible; landing snippets
  mirror `reqsign/examples/` and in-tree doc tests.
- **Design changes** to shared-skeleton styles should go through the sync
  procedure in `UPSTREAM_DESIGN.md`; Reqsign-identity overrides (accent,
  stroke motif, wordmark) are documented there and never synced.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `REQSIGN_WEBSITE_URL` | Overrides the canonical site URL |
| `REQSIGN_WEBSITE_BASE_URL` | Overrides `baseUrl` (fallback deployments) |
| `REQSIGN_WEBSITE_STAGING=true` | Marks the build as staging: sets `noIndex` |
