## Versioning

Reqsign publishes many crates on three tracks:

| Track | Crates | Scheme |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core + services | `reqsign-core`, `reqsign-aws-core`, every `reqsign-<provider>` service crate, `reqsign-file-read-tokio`, `reqsign-command-execute-tokio` | Lockstep major (currently `3.x`) |
| Reqwest adapter | `reqsign-http-send-reqwest` | Independent major (currently `4.x`), so reqwest major bumps do not force a core major |
| Facade | `reqsign` | Independent (currently `0.20.x`) |

Lockstep means any `3.x` service crate composes with any `3.x` core; mixing
majors fails to compile — the trait definitions are the compatibility
boundary, and Cargo enforces it.

Applications should depend on the facade and let it pin compatible
components; libraries should depend on `reqsign-core` plus their service
crates with major-only bounds, leaving context implementations to the
application:

```toml
# Application:
reqsign = { version = "0.20", features = ["aws"] }

# Library:
reqsign-core = "3"
reqsign-aws-v4 = "3"
```

Every release ships as an ASF source release plus crates.io packages — see
[Download](/download/). Release notes and migration steps for breaking
majors are published with each
[GitHub release](https://github.com/apache/reqsign/releases).

## Targets

**Rust version.** The workspace declares `rust-version = "1.85.0"` — the
minimum supported Rust. CI tracks stable; MSRV bumps are treated as
observable changes, not patch-level noise.

**Native.** Reqsign is pure Rust with no C dependencies of its own; CI
exercises Linux, macOS, and Windows. The default context components (Tokio
file reading and command execution, reqwest HTTP) run wherever those crates
do.

**WASM.** `wasm32-unknown-unknown` is a supported, CI-verified target for a
defined subset: `reqsign-core`, `reqsign-aws-core`, and the AWS SigV4, AWS
SigV4a, Azure Storage, Aliyun OSS, and Tencent COS providers. The
[provider matrix](/docs/providers/) is the authoritative per-provider
status; the [Custom runtimes & WASM guide](/docs/guides/custom-runtimes/)
covers building and browser-backed contexts.

**Async runtimes.** `reqsign-core` is runtime-agnostic — nothing in core
assumes Tokio. Runtime coupling lives only in the optional context crates;
swap them to run elsewhere.
