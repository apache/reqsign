If you are building your own HTTP client, SDK, proxy, or storage engine, the
real decision is between two ways of getting requests signed: pull in each
cloud's full SDK, or use a dedicated signing layer.

| | Reqsign | Vendor SDKs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scope** | Signing, credential loading, scoped granting — nothing else | The cloud's full API surface: clients, request/response models, transports |
| **HTTP client** | Yours — Reqsign mutates a plain `http::request::Parts` and hands it back | Bundled; requests flow through the SDK's own stack |
| **Retries, pooling, middleware** | Yours | The SDK's |
| **Dependency footprint** | One signing crate per provider, plus the runtime pieces you opt into | Per-cloud SDK trees, each with its own HTTP and TLS choices |
| **Multi-cloud** | One composition pattern (`Context` + `ProvideCredential` + `SignRequest`) across nine providers, protocols kept explicit | One SDK per cloud, each with its own idioms |
| **Custom runtimes / WASM** | Pluggable I/O via [`Context`](/docs/architecture/#context), `wasm32-unknown-unknown` for a [verified subset](/docs/reference/versioning-and-targets/#targets) | Generally assumes the SDK's supported runtimes |
| **Beyond signing** | Out of scope by design | Pagination, waiters, service helpers, management APIs |

## When Reqsign fits

You own the HTTP layer and want to keep it: a database's storage backend, a
CLI, a gateway, an SDK of your own. You need wire-correct signatures,
production-grade credential chains, and perhaps presigning or downscoped
grants — without inheriting a vendor SDK's HTTP stack, retry policy, and
dependency tree per cloud.

## When a vendor SDK fits

You need broad coverage of one cloud's API surface — management operations,
typed request/response models, service-specific helpers — and the SDK's
bundled stack fits your application. Signing is a fraction of what those SDKs
do; Reqsign replaces only that fraction.

## Relationship to Apache OpenDAL

Reqsign started inside [Apache OpenDAL™](https://opendal.apache.org/) and
graduated to a standalone Apache top-level project in 2026. The two remain
close, and the dependency points one way: OpenDAL's cloud storage services
sign their requests with Reqsign; Reqsign does not depend on OpenDAL.

The two serve different builders. Reqsign gives you signing primitives for a
client you are writing yourself. OpenDAL is a ready-made data access layer —
if what you actually want is to read and write storage behind one API rather
than construct requests, use OpenDAL and you get Reqsign's signing underneath
for free.
