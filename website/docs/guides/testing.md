Reqsign is built to be tested without touching real clouds: credentials are
injectable, and every I/O path routes through
[`Context`](/docs/architecture/#context).

## Deterministic signing tests

Fix the credential; the signature becomes a function of the request:

```rust
use reqsign_core::{Context, Signer};
use reqsign_aws_v4::{RequestSigner, StaticCredentialProvider};

let signer = Signer::new(
    Context::new(), // no I/O needed with static credentials
    StaticCredentialProvider::new("AKIDEXAMPLE", "example-secret-key", None),
    RequestSigner::new("s3", "us-east-1"),
);

let mut req = http::Request::builder()
    .method(http::Method::GET)
    .uri("https://s3.amazonaws.com/test-bucket/test-object")
    .body(())?
    .into_parts()
    .0;

signer.sign(&mut req, None).await?;
assert!(req.headers.contains_key("authorization"));
```

Use obviously fake material (`AKIDEXAMPLE`) in fixtures — never real keys,
not even expired ones.

## Mocking the environment

Credential chains read env vars and files through `Context`, so tests inject
them without process-global mutation:

```rust
use reqsign_core::{Context, Env};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct StaticEnv(std::collections::HashMap<String, String>);

impl Env for StaticEnv {
    fn var(&self, key: &str) -> Option<String> {
        self.0.get(key).cloned()
    }
    // ...remaining methods delegate similarly
}

let ctx = Context::new().with_env(StaticEnv(
    [("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID".into(), "AKIDEXAMPLE".into()),
     ("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY".into(), "example-secret-key".into())]
    .into(),
));
```

The same pattern applies to `HttpSend` (canned metadata/STS responses) and
`FileRead` (in-memory profiles). This is exactly how the repository tests
IMDS, ECS, SSO, and OIDC flows against local mock servers under
[`services/aws-v4/tests/mocks`](https://github.com/apache/reqsign/tree/main/services/aws-v4/tests/mocks).

## Integration tests against real services

Per-service integration suites live under `services/<name>/tests/` and stay
skipped unless their `REQSIGN_*` environment variables opt in — see each
suite's README for the exact gate. CI wires secrets for them; locally you can
run the mock-backed tests with plain `cargo test`.
