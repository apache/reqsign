# Reqsign Design System

> **Build. Sign. Send.** An engineering-grade visual language for Apache
> Reqsign™ — sharing its skeleton with the Apache OpenDAL™ website, carrying
> its own signature.

This document is the source of truth for Reqsign's web visual language. The
landing page (`src/pages/index.jsx`) is its first full application; docs and
providers pages inherit it through Infima variable mapping.

## 1. Skeleton and identity

The system deliberately splits into two layers with different change rules:

**Shared skeleton — inherited from the [OpenDAL Design System]
(https://github.com/apache/opendal/blob/main/website/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md), kept
in sync (see `UPSTREAM_DESIGN.md`):**

- Engineering-minimal, light-first; dark mode is a fully designed peer.
- Near-monochrome ink palette (`--rs-ink-*`).
- System sans and system mono only — zero web-font requests, zero layout
  shift, ASF-privacy-friendly. The mono stack doubles as a brand voice for
  labels, indices, and figures.
- 4px spacing rhythm; 1200px container with responsive gutters.
- Hairline structure: 1px borders, 1px grid gaps, restrained radius/shadow.
- Code-first, content-first layouts.
- CSS-only progressive motion honoring `prefers-reduced-motion`.

**Reqsign identity — intentional divergence, never synced from upstream:**

- **Seal green** (`--rs-green-*`) replaces OpenDAL's precise blue as the
  single accent. Green-700 `#0a7048` is the light-mode accent (≥ 4.5:1 on
  white); green-300 `#6fd6a8` is the dark-mode accent. In dark mode, primary
  actions invert to a bright-green surface with ink text — white-on-green
  cannot reach AA there.
- **The signature stroke** replaces OpenDAL's solid bar: the same solid
  quadrilateral, slanted by `--rs-stroke-skew` (−14°). Where the OpenDAL bar
  sits level like a storage layer, the Reqsign stroke leans forward like a
  pen closing a signature. Used in the eyebrow marker (`.rs-eyebrow::before`),
  the standalone `.rs-stroke`, the logo, and the favicon.
- **Wordmark**: the stroke plus "Reqsign" in the system stack
  (`static/img/logo.svg`, `logo_dark.svg`). The full `Apache Reqsign™` name
  appears in the page title, hero eyebrow, and footer attribution rather than
  inside the mark.

## 2. Where the system lives

| Concern | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Tokens + Infima mapping + motif | `src/css/custom.css` |
| Landing sections | `src/components/landing/sections.jsx` |
| Landing content model | `src/components/landing/data.js` |
| Code window / provider tabs | `src/components/landing/CodeTabs.jsx` |
| Landing styles | `src/components/landing/styles.module.css` |
| Provider facts &amp; matrix (embedded in docs) | `src/components/providers/` |

## 3. Token layers

1. **Primitives** — raw values: `--rs-ink-*`, `--rs-green-*`, type scale,
   spacing, radius, motion.
2. **Semantic** — theme-aware roles: `--rs-bg`, `--rs-fg`, `--rs-accent`,
   `--rs-action-*`, `--rs-stroke`. Components consume these, never
   primitives.
3. **Infima projection** — semantic tokens mapped onto `--ifm-*` so docs,
   navbar, and footer inherit the system without per-page styling.

The accent is replaceable at exactly one place (the semantic layer); nothing
downstream hard-codes a color.

## 4. Rules that keep it coherent

- One accent. Green marks interaction and emphasis; everything else is ink.
- The stroke stays sharp (no radius) and always skewed by the shared token.
- Mono for labels/metrics/eyebrows; sans for prose. Never mix per element.
- Light and dark ship together: every surface, chip, and code window is
  designed in both before landing.
- Accessibility gates: WCAG 2.1 AA contrast in both modes,
  `:focus-visible` outlines, keyboard-reachable tabs and navigation,
  `prefers-reduced-motion` honored by every animation.
- No third-party runtime assets — fonts, scripts, styles, and images are
  self-hosted (`scripts/check-external-assets.mjs` enforces this after every
  build).

## 5. Content rules

- Capability numbers and provider lists derive from `data/providers.json`;
  the page must not hand-write claims the catalog cannot back.
- Code shown on the landing page mirrors compiled examples
  (`reqsign/examples/`) or in-tree doc tests; docs snippets include real
  files via `remark-include-code`.
- Copy states what is verified, never "every cloud".
