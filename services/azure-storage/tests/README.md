# Azure Storage Tests

The Azure Storage test suite separates deterministic protocol parsing from live
credential-provider acceptance tests. Unit tests parse sanitized responses that
were captured from Azure. Integration tests obtain credentials from the real
provider and use `RequestSigner` to read a private blob prepared for that test run.

```

The credential-provider tests do not use HTTP mocks. A live test succeeds only
after Azure Blob Storage returns the expected object body.

## Local Tests

Run the deterministic suite without Azure credentials:

```bash
cargo test -p reqsign-azure-storage --lib --tests --no-fail-fast
```

Live tests are disabled unless their provider-specific environment variable is
set to `on`. For example:

```bash
REQSIGN_AZURE_STORAGE_TEST_CLI=on \
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT=example \
AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER=container \
bash .github/azure-live-tests/with-probe.sh cargo test -p reqsign-azure-storage --test main \
  credential_providers::azure_cli::test_azure_cli_provider -- --exact
```

## Live Test Configuration

Every live provider test requires `REQSIGN_AZURE_STORAGE_PROBE_URL`. The URL must
identify a blob that contains `reqsign-live-azure-ok\n`. Run live tests through
`.github/azure-live-tests/with-probe.sh` to create a uniquely named private blob,
set this URL for the child command, and delete the blob when the command exits,
including on test failure. Concurrent jobs and failed-job reruns use independent
objects. The storage account and private container must already exist.

The wrapper uses an existing Azure CLI login with permission to create and delete
fixture blobs. Set `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` and `AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER` to the
fixture location. Fixture setup credentials are separate from the provider being
tested; providers only need read access. For Shared Key and SAS tests, set
`AZURE_STORAGE_AUTH_MODE=key` and `REQSIGN_AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY`. The wrapper
also generates a two-hour, read-only SAS for the new blob and exports it as
`REQSIGN_AZURE_STORAGE_SAS_TOKEN`. Direct Cargo invocations can still use a
caller-prepared blob through `REQSIGN_AZURE_STORAGE_PROBE_URL`.

Lifecycle policies may remove abandoned fixtures after interrupted jobs; no test
depends on a blob surviving between runs.

| Variable | Provider |
| --- | --- |
| `REQSIGN_AZURE_STORAGE_TEST` | `StaticCredentialProvider` |
| `REQSIGN_AZURE_STORAGE_TEST_ENV` | `EnvCredentialProvider` |
| `REQSIGN_AZURE_STORAGE_TEST_DEFAULT` | `DefaultCredentialProvider` |
| `REQSIGN_AZURE_STORAGE_TEST_IMDS` | `ImdsCredentialProvider` |
| `REQSIGN_AZURE_STORAGE_TEST_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY` | `WorkloadIdentityCredentialProvider` |
| `REQSIGN_AZURE_STORAGE_TEST_CLI` | `AzureCliCredentialProvider` |
| `REQSIGN_AZURE_STORAGE_TEST_CLIENT_SECRET` | `ClientSecretCredentialProvider` |
| `REQSIGN_AZURE_STORAGE_TEST_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE` | `ClientCertificateCredentialProvider` |
| `REQSIGN_AZURE_STORAGE_TEST_PIPELINES` | `AzurePipelinesCredentialProvider` |

The source providers use these values:

| Variable | Credential |
| --- | --- |
| `REQSIGN_AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` | Static Shared Key account name |
| `REQSIGN_AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY` | Static Shared Key account key |
| `REQSIGN_AZURE_STORAGE_SAS_TOKEN` | Static SAS token |
| `REQSIGN_AZURE_STORAGE_BEARER_TOKEN` | Static bearer token |
| `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` | Environment Shared Key account name |
| `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY` | Environment Shared Key account key |
| `AZURE_STORAGE_SAS_TOKEN` | Environment SAS token |
| `AZURE_STORAGE_BEARER_TOKEN` | Environment bearer token |

The Entra providers use the standard Azure variables, including
`AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`,
`AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH`, and `AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE`.
`AzurePipelinesCredentialProvider` receives
`AZURESUBSCRIPTION_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURESUBSCRIPTION_TENANT_ID`,
`AZURESUBSCRIPTION_SERVICE_CONNECTION_ID`, and `SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN` from an
`AzureCLI@2` task.

## CI Coverage

GitHub Actions runs deterministic unit tests for all changes. Each credential
provider has an independent live-test job, matching the AWS workflow's failure
isolation and summary structure. Trusted same-repository changes run live tests
for:

- Static Shared Key, SAS, and bearer credentials.
- Environment Shared Key, SAS, and bearer credentials.
- Client secret and client certificate credentials.
- Azure CLI and GitHub workload identity credentials.
- The default credential chain.
- IMDS on an ephemeral private Azure VM with a user-assigned managed identity.
- Shared Key and SAS request signing against Azure Blob Storage.

The IMDS job uploads the test binary to a private blob, creates a VM without a
public IP, runs the exact provider test through Azure Run Command, and removes
the VM and uploaded binary in unconditional cleanup steps. Each VM deployment
attempt has a distinct name. Cleanup covers every attempted deployment, including
NICs and disks left behind when VM creation fails.

GitHub Actions queues `AzurePipelinesCredentialProvider` through the Azure
DevOps REST API and waits for the result as part of the GitHub check. The queued
run receives the exact GitHub ref and commit plus a temporary probe URL created
by the GitHub job. Its Azure Resource Manager workload-identity service connection
keeps Blob Reader access; the GitHub job owns fixture creation and cleanup and
cancels an unfinished pipeline before releasing the fixture. Azure DevOps has no
repository or scheduled trigger for this pipeline. It uses a dedicated Azure VM
Scale Set agent pool with one-node maximum capacity, zero standby agents, and
automatic recycling after every job.

The Azure DevOps pipeline definition must declare the non-secret variable
`REQSIGN_AZURE_STORAGE_PROBE_URL` with an empty default and **Let users override
this value when running this pipeline** enabled (`allowOverride: true` in the
Build Definitions API). GitHub supplies this value when queuing each run. Keep
the organization-level restriction on other queue-time variables enabled.
Azure DevOps YAML previews do not validate this permission; verify it with an
actual queued run.

The final summary reports and enforces every provider and signing job
independently for trusted changes.

## 1Password Configuration

GitHub Actions reads the existing `reqsign/azure-storage` item through
1Password Connect. The workflow uses these existing fields without renaming or
creating fields:

- `account_name`
- `account_key`
- `tenant_id`
- `client_id`
- `client_secret`
- `certificate_pem_base64`

## Updating Fixtures

Fixtures must come from the corresponding real Azure endpoint or command. Mask
access tokens, client IDs, tenant IDs, subscription IDs, and user-identifying
fields before committing the response. Preserve field names, JSON value types,
and time formats so the parser test continues to represent the service contract.
